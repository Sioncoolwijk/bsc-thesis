# Thesis Project

#### General information
This repository contains the code for my Bachelor's Thesis in Information Sciences at the University of Amsterdam. It was authored by S.A. Coolwijk.

Included in this repo are all the files necessary for creating a website. This website initially serves as a survey via an embedded Google Forms link. Additionally, it facilitates an experiment/assignment utiziling an OpenAI API in which students can participate.

#### Front-End

The CSS, JS, HTML, and .htaccess files have been added to the webspace manager of STRATO (the host) to render the website. The website is live as of May 16, 2023, and can be accessed here until July 2023: onderzoeknaarchatgpt.nl.

#### Back-End

I've set up a server that deploys our Node.js application via our index.js file. The modules and packages this application depends on are created using the npm init command.
